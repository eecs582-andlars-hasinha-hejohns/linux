Run the following commands at the root directory:
make x86_64_defconfig
make kvm_guest.config
make modules

# Do not worry if make modules fails... only needed to generate some files expected in build

navigate to fs/ and run the following commands to build:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make

# cmake should install when you install build-essentials
# everytime you modify the cmake it is recomended to delete build directory and restart
# only need to run make if you change source files... not cmake
